# The build system


### Overview

The Fuchsia build system aims at building complete boot images for various
devices. To do so, it uses [GN][gn-main], a meta-build system that generates
build files consumed by [Ninja][ninja-main] to execute the actual build.

The contents of the generated image are controlled by a set of modules defining
what should go into the GN build and what should be packaged into the image.


### Modules

Module definitions can be found under [`//packages/gn`][modules-source]. A
module contains references to other modules it builds on top of (`imports`),
the GN targets it needs built (`labels`), and how to pack the build outputs into
the final image (`binaries`):
```
{
    "imports": [
        "foo_framework”,
        “some_extra_data”
    ],
    "labels": [
        "//my/stuff/depends_on_foo",
        "//my/stuff/api_for_others"
    ],
    "binaries": [
        {
            "binary": "path/in/output/tree/my_foo_base_stuff",
            "bootfs_path": "apps/best_app_ever"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Build targets

Build targets are defined in `BUILD.gn` files scattered all over the source
tree. These files use a Python-like syntax to declare buildable objects:
```
import("//build/some/template.gni")

my_template("foo") {
  name = "foo"
  extra_options = "//my/foo/options"
  deps = [
    "//some/random/framework",
    "//some/other/random/framework",
  ]
}
```
Available commands and constructs are defined in the
[GN reference][gn-reference]. There are also a handful of custom templates in
`.gni` files in the [`//build` project][build-project].

### Executing a build

##### A

The first step is to build the Magenta kernel which uses its own build system:
```
$ scripts/build-magenta.sh
```

##### B

Then configure the content of the generated image by choosing the modules to
incorporate:
```
$ packages/gn/gen.py --modules fuchsia_base,my_stuff
```
This will create an `out/debug-<arch>` directory containing Ninja files to run
the build.

##### C

The final step is to run the actual build with Ninja:
```
$ buildtools/ninja -C out/debug-x86-64 -j64
```

### Rebuilding

#### After modifying non-module files

In order to rebuild the tree after modifying some sources, just rerun step
**C**. This holds true even if you modify `BUILD.gn` files as GN adds Ninja
targets to update Ninja targets if build files are changed!

#### After modifying module files

If you modified the list of `labels` in a module file you include in your build,
or if you need to include a new module, you should rerun **B** before running
**C** again.

#### After syncing sources

You’ll most likely need to run **A** once if anything in the Magenta tree was
changed. After that, run **C** again.
In the rare case that a module file you depend on was sync’d in the process,
you’ll also need to run **B** in the usual order.


### Tips and tricks

#### Visualizing the hierarchy of build modules

```
$ scripts/visualize_module_tree.py > tree.dot
$ dot -Tpng tree.dot -o tree.png
```

#### Inspecting the content of a GN target

```
$ packages/gn/gn.py desc out/debug-x86-64 //path/to/my:target
```

#### Finding references to a GN target

```
$ packages/gn/gn.py refs out/debug-x86-64 //path/to/my:target
```

#### Referencing targets for the build host

Various host tools (some used in the build itself) need to be built along with
the final image.

To reference a build target for the host toolchain from a module file:
```
//path/to/target(//build/toolchain:host_x64)
```
To reference a build target for the host toolchain from within a `BUILD.gn`
file:
```
//path/to/target($host_toolchain)
```

#### Building only a specific target

If a target is defined in a GN build file as `//foo/bar/blah:dash`, that target
(and its dependencies) can be built with:
```
$ buildtools/ninja -C out/debug-x86-64 -j64 foo/bar/blah:dash
```

#### Exploring Ninja targets

GN extensively documents which Ninja targets it generates. The documentation is
accessible with:
```
$ packages/gn/gn.py help ninja_rules
```

You can also browse the set of Ninja targets currently defined in your output
directory with:
```
$ buildtools/ninja -C out/debug-x86-64 -t browse
```
Note that the presence of a Ninja target does not mean it will be built - for
that it needs to depend on the “default” target.

#### Understanding why Ninja does what it does

Add `-d explain` to your Ninja command to have it explain every step of its
execution.

#### Debugging build timing issues

When running a build, Ninja keeps logs that can be used to generate
visualizations of the build process:

1. Delete your output directory - this is to ensure the logs represent only the
   build iteration you’re about to run;
1. Run a build as you would normally do;
1. Get <https://github.com/nico/ninjatracing>;
1. Run `ninjatracing <output directory>`;
1. Load the resulting json file in Chrome in `about:tracing`.


### Troubleshooting

#### My GN target is not being built!

Make sure it rolls up to a label defined in a module file, otherwise the build
system will ignore it.

#### GN complains about a missing `sysroot`.

You likely forgot to run **A** before running **B**.
