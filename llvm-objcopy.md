LLVM already implements its own version of almost all of binutils. The
exceptions to this rule are objcopy and strip. This is a proposal to implement
an llvm version of objcopy/strip to complete llvm’s binutils.

Several projects only use gnu binutils because of objcopy/strip. LLVM itself
uses objcopy in fact. Chromium and Fuchsia currently use objcopy as well. If you
want to distribute your build tools this is a problem due to licensing. It’s
also a bit of a blemish on LLVM because LLVM could be made more self sufficient
if there was an llvm version of objcopy. Additionally Chromium is one of the
popular benchmarks for LLVM so it would be nice if Chromium didn’t have to use
binutils. Using
[elftoolchain](https://sourceforge.net/p/elftoolchain/wiki/Home/)
solves the licensing issue for Fuchsia but is elf specific and only solves the
issue for Fuchsia. I propose implementing llvm-objcopy to be a minimum viable
replacement for objcopy.

I’ve gone though the sources of LLVM, Clang, Chromium, and Fuchsia to try and
find the major use cases of objcopy. Here is a list of use cases I have found
and which projects use them. This list includes some use cases not found in
these 4 projects.

1. Use Case: Stripping debug information of an executable to a file  
   Who uses it: LLVM, Fuchsia, Chromium

   ```sh
   objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.debug
   objcopy --strip-debug foo foo
   ```

   [Example use](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/cd789d8cfe12aa374e66eafc748f4fc06e149ca7/cmake/modules/AddLLVM.cmake)
   When it is useful:  
   This reduces the size of the file for distribution while maintaining the debug
   information in a file for later use. Anyone distributing an executable in
   anyway could benefit from this.

2. Use Case: Stripping debug information of a relocatable object to a file  
   Who uses it: None of the 4 projects considered

   ```sh
   objcopy --only-keep-debug foo.o foo.debug
   objcopy --strip-debug foo.o foo.o
   ```

   When it is useful:  
   In distribution of an SDK in the form of an archive it would be nice to strip
   this information. This allows debug information to be distributed separately.

3. Use Case: Stripping debug information of a shared library to a file  
   Who uses it: None of the 4 projects

   ```sh
   objcopy --only-keep-debug foo.so foo.debug
   objcopy --strip-debug foo.so foo.so
   ```

   When is it Useful:  
   Same benefits as the previous case. If you want to distribute a library this
   option allows you to distribute a smaller binary while maintaining the ability
   to debug.

4. Use Case:		Stripping an executable
   Who uses it:		None of the 4 projects

   ```sh
   objcopy --strip-all foo foo
   ```

   When is it useful:  
   Anytime an executable is being distributed and there is no reason to keep
   debugging information. This makes the executable smaller than simply
   stripping debug info and doesn't produce an extra file.

5. Use Case: “Complete stripping” an executable  
   Who uses it: None of the 4 projects
   ```sh
   eu-strip --strip-sections foo
   ```
   When is it useful:  
   This is an extreme form of stripping that even strips the section headers
   since they are not needed for loading. This is useful in the same contexts as
   stripping but some tools and dynamic linkers may be confused by it. This is
   possibly only valid on ELF unlike general stripping which is a valid option on
   multiple platforms.

6. Use Case: DWARF fission  
   Who uses it: Clang, Fuchsia, Chromium

   ```sh
   objcopy --extract-dwo foo foo.debug
   objcopy --strip-dwo foo foo
   ```

   [Example use  1](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/3efd04e48004628cfaffead00ecb1c206b0b6cb2/lib/Driver/ToolChains/CommonArgs.cpp)
   [Example use 2](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/a0badfbffbee71c2c757d580fc852d2124dadc5a/test/Driver/split-debug.s)

   When is it useful:  
   DWARF fission can be used to speed up large builds. In some cases builds can
   be too large to be handled and DWARF fission makes this manageable. DWARF
   fission is useful in almost any project of sufficient size.

7. Use Case: Converting an executable to binary  
   Who uses it: Fuchsia

   ```sh
   objcopy -O binary magenta.elf magenta.bin
   ```

   [Example use](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/make/build.mk#20)

   When is it useful:  
   For kernels and embedded applications that need just the raw segments.

8. Use Case: Adding a gdb index  
   Who uses it: Chromium

   ```sh
   gdb -batch foo -ex "save gdb-index dir" -ex quit
   objcopy --add-section .gdb_index="dir/foo.gdb-index" \
           --set-section-flags .gdb_index=readonly foo foo
   ```

   [Example use](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/build/gdb-add-index?type=cs&q=objcopy&l=71)

   When is it useful:  
   Adding a gdb index reduces startup time for debugging an application. Any
   sufficiently large program with a sufficiently large amount of debug
   information can potentially benefit from this.

9. Use Case: Converting between formats  
   Who uses it: Fuchsia (only in Magenta GCC build)

   ```sh
   objcopy --target=pei-x86-64 magenta.elf megenta.pe
   ```

   [Example use](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/bootloader/build.mk#97)

   When is it useful:  
   This is primarily useful when you can’t directly target a needed format.

10. Use Case: Removing symbols not needed for relocation  
    Who uses it: Chromium

    ```sh
    objcopy --strip-unneeded foo foo
    ```

    [Example use](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/libevdev/src/common.mk?type=cs&q=objcopy&l=397)

    When is it useful:  
    This is useful when shipping an SDK or some relocatable binaries.

11. Use Case: Removing local symbols  
    Who uses it: LLVM

    ```sh
    objcopy --discard-all foo foo
    ```

    [Example use](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/cd789d8cfe12aa374e66eafc748f4fc06e149ca7/cmake/modules/AddLLVM.cmake)
    (hidden in definition of “strip_command” using strip instead of objcopy and
    using -x instead of --discard-all)

    When is it useful:  
    Anytime you don’t need locals for debugging this can be useful.

12. Use Case: Removing a specific unwanted section  
    Who uses it: LLVM

    ```sh
    objcopy --remove-section=.debug_aranges foo foo
    ```

    [Example use](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/93e6e5414ded14bcbb233baaaa5567132fee9a0c/test/DebugInfo/Inputs/fission-ranges.cc)

    When is it useful:
    This is useful when you know that you have an unwanted section that isn’t
    removed by one of the other stripping options. This can also be used to
    remove an existing section for replacement by a new section.

We would like to build this up incrementally by solving specific use cases
as they come up. To start with we would like to tackle the use cases
important to us. We primarily care about fully linked executables and not
relocatable files. I plan to implement conversion from ELF to binary first.
After that I plan on implementing stripping for ELF executables.
